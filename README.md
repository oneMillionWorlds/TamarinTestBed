# TamarinTestBed
An example project that uses Tamarin to produce a simple VR game.

Note that each example aims to be self-contained. This is not usually a good way of doing things but as 
each of these examples is imagined as being an inspiration to a seperate project this appproach is
used here.

Note that this was tested with Occulus only, other controllers should only "theoretically" work. Please
put in a PR if you find that the bindings for other controllers are wrong.
